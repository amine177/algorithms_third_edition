The traveling-salesman problem incorporates the concept
of a "global" shortest path, one that permits to go
through all destinations with the least resource consuming
way, for that we would need to calculate a shortest path
in one way or another.
The difference is that the shortest-path isn't always concerned
with going through all possible destinations, so it becomes
different from the traveling-slaesman problem.
